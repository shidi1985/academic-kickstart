Dr. Di Shi is an Associate Professor at the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU), where he holds the Paul W. and Valerie Klipsch Distinguished Professorship.

Before joining NMSU, Dr. Shi founded AInergy, a tech startup aimed at commercializing his innovative technologies and software solutions, which are now deployed by 15 utility companies. Prior to founding AInergy, he held leadership roles at GEIRINA, serving as a Researcher, Director of the Fundamental R&D Center, and Department Head of AI & System Analytics. Earlier in his career, Dr. Shi conducted research at NEC Laboratories America (NECLA), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and Arizona State University (ASU). He also worked part-time as a Principal/Senior Consultant for two consulting firms.

Dr. Shi is deeply engaged in the academic and professional community. He serves or has served as associate editors for leading journals, including IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, IEEE Power Engineering Letters, IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution, and the Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy. He previously served as the Chair of the IEEE San Francisco Section Chapter PES and currently serves as the Chair of the IEEE Task Force on IoT for Power Systems and Vice Chair of the IEEE Working Group on Machine Learning for Power Systems. Dr. Shi is also a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

Dr. Shi has authored or co-authored over 180 journal and conference papers and holds 42 patents and patent applications. His work has received 11 Best Paper Awards across prestigious journals and conferences. In 2019, Dr. Shi led his team to win the championship in the Power System AI competition L2RPN. Additionally, two technologies developed by his team have been commercialized, delivering real-world solutions and significant energy savings. The software packages, hardware solutions, and platforms created under his leadership are widely adopted by utilities to enhance operational efficiency.
