Dr. Di Shi is an Associate Professor in the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU), where he holds the Paul W. and Valerie Klipsch Distinguished Professorship.

Before joining NMSU, Dr. Shi founded AInergy, a tech startup that commercializes research-driven technologies and software solutions now deployed by 15 utility companies. Prior to AInergy, he held leadership roles at GEIRINA, including Researcher, Director of the Fundamental R&D Center, and Department Head of AI & System Analytics. Earlier in his career, he conducted research at NEC Laboratories America (NECLA), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and Arizona State University (ASU). He also worked part-time as a Principal/Senior Consultant for two consulting firms.

Dr. Shi is involved in the academic and professional community. He serves or has served as an associate editor for journals including IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, IEEE Power Engineering Letters, IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution, and the Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy. He previously served as Chair of the IEEE San Francisco Section PES Chapter and currently serves as Chair of the IEEE Task Force on IoT for Power Systems and Vice Chair of the IEEE Working Group on Machine Learning for Power Systems. He is also a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

Dr. Shi has authored or co-authored over 190 journal and conference papers and holds 42 patents and patent applications. His work has received 11 Best Paper Awards across journals and conferences. In 2019, he led his team to win the championship in the L2RPN power system AI competition. In addition, technologies developed under his leadership have been commercialized, and the associated software packages, hardware solutions, and platforms are used by utilities to improve operational efficiency and system resilience.
