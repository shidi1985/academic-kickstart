Dr. Di Shi is an associate professor with the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU).

Before joining NMSU, Dr. Shi founded AInergy, a startup providing AI and IoT driven solutions for power systems. Prior to AInergy, he was a Researcher, Director of Fundamental R&D Center and Department Head of the AI & System Analytics Group at GEIRINA. Prior to GEIRINA, he held various research positions at NEC Laboratories America (NECLA), Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and ASU. He also worked as (part-time) Principal/Senior Consultant for two consulting firms. 

Dr. Shi serves as Editor of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, IEEE Power Engineering Letters, IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution, Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, and Chair of IEEE San Francisco Section Chapter PES. He also serves as Chair of IEEE TF of IoT for Power Systems, and Secretary of IEEE Working Group of Machine Learning for Power Systems. He served as editor of IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid during 2017-2021. He is a Fellow of IET.

Dr. Shi authored/co-authored over 170 journal and conference papers, and holds 42 patents/patent applications. He and his team have received 10 Best Paper Awards from various journals and conferences. He led his team to win the Championship of the 2019 Power System AI competition ***L2RPN***. Two technologies and solutions he and his team developed have been commercialized into products that help customers solve real-world problems with significant energy savings. Several software packages and platforms he developed have been adopted by utilities to run at multiple grid dispatch centers.
