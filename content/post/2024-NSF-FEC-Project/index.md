I am very pleased to lead this $6M NSF project titled "RII FEC: Accelerating Community-Centric Energy Transformation through AI-driven Digital Twinning for Climate-Aware Resilience". This project addresses the urgent challenge of climate change intertwined with the country's aging energy infrastructure, a challenge most critical in underserved communities.

I feel very grateful for the hard work from my collaborators from NMSU and other institutions, and the strong support I received from the ECE department. Over the next four years, the team will work together to develop digital twins to transform the energy systems, leveraging the power of AI and foundational and large language models.

Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this transformative journey!
