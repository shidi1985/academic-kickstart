New Mexico State University has been awarded a $14.2 million project from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to advance pumped-storage hydropower (PSH), a critical technology for renewable energy integration and grid resilience.

This award reflects over three years of sustained effort by NMSU researchers, state leaders, and community partners. The project is led by Dr. Fengyu Wang (PI), in collaboration with the Navajo Nation and national research institutions.

Dr. Shi plays a central leadership role, heading the project’s AI and dynamic modeling and simulation research. His expertise will ensure that advanced computational methods are developed to evaluate PSH feasibility, optimize system operations, and enhance long-term energy resilience.

This achievement was made possible thanks to the $3.1 million cost-share support from the New Mexico Department of Higher Education and the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

The project will:

--Assess the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of PSH development.

--Develop AI-enabled dynamic modeling, simulation, and control frameworks for secure and efficient PSH-grid integration.

--Advance energy resilience for the Navajo Nation and underserved communities.

This milestone underscores NMSU’s growing national leadership in sustainable energy innovation and resilient infrastructure research, with strong state and community backing.
