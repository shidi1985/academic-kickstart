New Mexico State University has been awarded a $14.2 million project to advance pumped-storage hydropower (PSH), a critical technology for renewable energy integration and grid resilience.

This effort is supported by $7.1 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and $7.1 million in cost-share contributions from the New Mexico Department of Higher Education and the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) — a true federal–state partnership.

The award reflects over three years of sustained effort by NMSU researchers and partners. The project is led by Dr. Fengyu Wang (PI) in collaboration with the Navajo Nation and national research institutions.

As Co-PI, Dr. Shi leads the project’s AI and dynamic modeling and simulation research, developing cutting-edge computational methods to evaluate PSH feasibility, simulate dynamic behavior, optimize control strategies, and enhance long-term energy resilience.

The project will:

--Assess the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of PSH development.

--Develop AI-enabled dynamic modeling, simulation, and control frameworks for secure and efficient PSH-grid integration.

--Advance energy resilience for the Navajo Nation and underserved communities.

This milestone underscores NMSU’s growing national leadership in sustainable energy innovation and resilient infrastructure research, with strong state and community backing.
